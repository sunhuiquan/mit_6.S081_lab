1.(1)Which registers contain arguments to functions?
	   a0-a7 for integer and fa0-fa7 for float.
  (2)For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
	   Using a2.	   

2.(1)Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main?
       The complier is so powerful, which has optimized this process,
	   and even call nothing.(li a1,12 and 12 is the final value).
  (2)Where is the call to g? (The compiler may inline functions)
  	   It didn't call g for optimizing. 

3.At what address is the function printf located?
	   At 0x630.

4.What value is in the register ra just after the 
  jalr to printf in main?
	   0x38.

5.Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
 (1) What is the output?
 	   He110 World
 (2)The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian.
  If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in
  order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to
  a different value?
	   No need to change 57616, but need to reverse i.

6.printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
  (1)In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='?
     note: the answer is not a specific value.
	   The value in a2.
  (2)Why does this happen?
       It's a call to printf and the second %d will use the third
	   argument, which is in a2.
